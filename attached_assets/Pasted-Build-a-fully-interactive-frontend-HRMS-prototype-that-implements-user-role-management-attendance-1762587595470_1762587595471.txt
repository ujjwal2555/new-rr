Build a fully interactive frontend HRMS prototype that implements user & role management, attendance & leave flows, payroll summary & payslip generation, dashboards & charts, and admin/HR/payroll officer views. All data is local-only (in-memory + localStorage) and populated with realistic dummy data. No backend required. All features must be functional and interactive (forms, tables, approvals, edits) but persistence only to browser storage. Include a role switcher to simulate different users and permissions.

Tech stack (recommended)

Framework: React (v18) + React Router

Styling: Tailwind CSS (use default utility classes)

Charts: Recharts (or Chart.js)

UI library optional: Headless UI / Radix for dialogs (but keep design custom/sleek)

State: React Context + localStorage adapter (no external DB)

Build: Vite or Create React App

Linting & testing: ESLint + basic jest/react-testing-library tests (optional)

Pages / Routes

/ — Login (role selector + demo accounts)

/dashboard — Role-aware dashboard (Employee / HR / Admin / Payroll)

/attendance — Mark attendance + monthly calendar + attendance log

/leave — Apply for leave, view requests, approve/reject (role-based workflow)

/employees — Directory with CRUD (Admin/HR), view-only for Employee/Payroll

/payroll — Payrun generator, payslip list, single payslip view, export PDF (frontend)

/reports — Simple analytics pages: attendance summary, leaves summary, payroll summary

/profile — Editable user profile

/settings — Role management, basic app settings (Admin only)

/help — Short in-app help / legend

Key Behaviors / Requirements (must be implemented)

Login & Role switcher

Demo accounts: Admin / HR Officer / Payroll Officer / Employee.

No password required — clicking a demo card signs in as that role.

Also provide a role dropdown in header to quickly impersonate another role for testing.

Role-based access control

Admin: full CRUD across modules + settings.

HR Officer: manage employee profiles, view attendance, allocate leaves, cannot access payroll settings.

Payroll Officer: approve/reject leave requests, run payruns, generate payslips, view payroll reports.

Employee: mark attendance, apply for leave, view own payslips and attendance.

UI should hide or disable actions the current role cannot perform.

Local data model & persistence

Use a JSON data model stored in localStorage under key workzen_demo_data.

On first load, seed localStorage with provided dummy data (see Dummy Data section).

Provide a “Reset demo data” button in Settings.

Attendance

Employees can “Clock In” and “Clock Out” (or “Mark Present” for the day).

Attendance entries include: id, userId, date, inTime, outTime, status (Present/Absent/Half), notes.

Monthly calendar view with color-coded days and daily detail drawer.

HR/Admin can edit attendance records.

Leave management

Employee can apply for leave (type, start date, end date, reason).

Leave statuses: Pending, Approved, Rejected, Cancelled.

Workflow: Employee applies → Payroll/Payroll Officer or Admin (depending on role) approves/rejects.

Leave balance tracking per user (simple counters).

Approvals generate notifications in UI and are reflected in attendance/payroll calculations.

Payroll

Basic payroll generator that creates a payrun for a selected month.

Salary model per employee: basic, hra, otherEarnings, deductions (PF, professionalTax), tax, net.

Payroll calculation uses: base salary prorated by days present (approved leaves included based on type), PF = 12% of basic, professional tax = flat value from user salary settings.

Payroll Officer/Admin can generate/edit payruns and download payslips as a simple PDF-like printable view (frontend only).

Payslip view shows breakdown and allows saving or re-generating.

Dashboard & Analytics

Role-specific dashboard tiles: total employees, today present, pending leaves, payroll expenses this month.

Charts: Attendance over last 30 days (line), Leave distribution by type (pie), Payroll cost trend (bar).

Charts are interactive and respond to date range filters.

Employee directory & profiles

List of employees with search + filter by department/role.

Employee profile modal with personal info, contact, salary details, leave balance, last 3 payslips, attendance summary.

HR/Admin can create/update/delete employees; changes saved to localStorage.

User profile & settings

Users can edit their name, email, contact, and avatar (avatar can be initials or uploaded base64).

Admin can manage roles & system settings (e.g., PF percentage, professional tax).

Notifications & toasts

Show toasts for successful actions (leave submitted, approved, payrun generated, profile updated).

Simple bell icon with list of last N notifications.

Forms & Validation

All forms have client-side validation (required fields, sensible date checks: end >= start).

Inline errors + disable submit when invalid.

Accessibility & Responsiveness

Keyboard navigable modals, aria labels for interactive components.

Fully responsive: sidebar collapses on mobile, key pages stack vertically.

UI/UX & Design

Clean, modern HR dashboard aesthetic with a soft palette (purple/teal accents).

Use cards for metrics, table rows with hover actions, and modals for forms.

Provide a consistent header with user avatar, role label, and quick role switcher.

In tables allow inline actions (edit, delete, approve/reject) and bulk actions for Admin.

Use small micro-animations for modal open/close and toasts.

Dummy Data (copyable JSON)
Provide this as the seeded data for localStorage:

{
  "users": [
    {"id": "u1","name":"Alice Admin","role":"admin","email":"alice@demo.com","department":"Management","salary":{"basic":90000,"hra":18000,"otherEarnings":5000},"leaveBalance":{"annual":18,"sick":10}},
    {"id": "u2","name":"Harry HR","role":"hr","email":"harry@demo.com","department":"HR","salary":{"basic":60000,"hra":12000,"otherEarnings":3000},"leaveBalance":{"annual":18,"sick":8}},
    {"id": "u3","name":"Pam Payroll","role":"payroll","email":"pam@demo.com","department":"Finance","salary":{"basic":65000,"hra":13000,"otherEarnings":3000},"leaveBalance":{"annual":18,"sick":8}},
    {"id": "u4","name":"Eve Employee","role":"employee","email":"eve@demo.com","department":"Engineering","salary":{"basic":50000,"hra":10000,"otherEarnings":2000},"leaveBalance":{"annual":12,"sick":6}},
    {"id": "u5","name":"Sam Staff","role":"employee","email":"sam@demo.com","department":"Design","salary":{"basic":45000,"hra":9000,"otherEarnings":1500},"leaveBalance":{"annual":12,"sick":6}}
  ],
  "attendance": [
    {"id":"a1","userId":"u4","date":"2025-10-01","inTime":"09:05","outTime":"17:30","status":"Present"},
    {"id":"a2","userId":"u5","date":"2025-10-01","inTime":"09:15","outTime":"17:10","status":"Present"}
  ],
  "leaves": [
    {"id":"l1","userId":"u4","type":"Annual","start":"2025-10-10","end":"2025-10-12","status":"Pending","reason":"Family travel"},
    {"id":"l2","userId":"u5","type":"Sick","start":"2025-09-05","end":"2025-09-06","status":"Approved","reason":"Fever"}
  ],
  "payruns": [
    {"id":"p1","month":"2025-09","generatedBy":"u3","totalPayroll":85000,"items":[{"userId":"u4","gross":60000,"deductions":6000,"net":54000},{"userId":"u5","gross":55000,"deductions":5500,"net":49500}]}
  ],
  "settings": {"pfPercent":12,"professionalTax":200}
}


Local Calculation Rules (simple)

Gross = basic + hra + otherEarnings

PF = (pfPercent / 100) * basic

Pro-rata: If days present < workingDaysInMonth, prorate basic accordingly

Net = Gross - PF - professionalTax - otherDeductions

Interactive Example Flows (acceptance criteria)

Employee (u4) logs in → marks attendance today → attendance table updates → admin sees new entry.

Employee applies leave for Oct 10–12 → leave appears in Pending → Payroll Officer logs in and approves → status updates to Approved → leave days deduced from leaveBalance; attendance entries for those days show Approved Leave state.

Payroll Officer runs payrun for Sep 2025 → system computes per-user gross/deductions using attendance & leaves → generates payslip → payroll list shows payrun with downloadable payslip.

HR creates a new employee via modal → new record is appended and visible in directory.

Admin changes PF percentage in Settings → payrun calculation uses new PF (%) for next payrun.

Components to build

Auth/Login cards (demo accounts)

Header with role switcher & notifications

Sidebar navigation (collapsible)

Dashboard cards & charts

Attendance calendar & daily drawer

Leave application modal & requests table

Employee table, profile modal, CRUD forms

Payroll generator modal, payrun table, payslip printable component

Settings & small forms

Toast/notification system

Local storage data provider + seed/ reset button

UX copy & microcopy

Buttons: “Clock In”, “Clock Out”, “Apply Leave”, “Approve”, “Reject”, “Generate Payrun”, “Download Payslip”, “Reset Demo Data”

Empty states with CTA: “No attendance yet — Clock in now”, “No pending leaves”

Confirmation modals for destructive actions (Delete employee, Reset data)

Accessibility

Buttons, inputs have proper aria-labels.

Modal traps focus; ESC closes modals.

Color contrast should be sufficient for readability.

Deliverables from Lovable

A complete frontend project (React + Tailwind) in a single downloadable ZIP or Git repo scaffold.

Seeded localStorage demo data and a “Reset demo data” option.

README with run instructions:

npm install

npm run dev

How to switch roles and reset demo data

How to export payslip (print view)

Minimal unit tests for 3 key components (attendance, leave, payroll calc) — optional but preferred.

A short demo script (steps) for the hackathon judges to validate features.

Developer notes / constraints for builder

Do not implement any real authentication/backend — all actions are client-side.

No external APIs for payroll or PDF generation; the payslip should be a printable HTML view (use window.print()).

All data must be editable in-app and persisted to localStorage.

Keep component code modular and documented (propTypes or TypeScript typing recommended).

Commit history: include at least 8 meaningful git commits demonstrating iterative work (seed data, components, pages, role logic, payroll calc, charts, print/payslip, styling).

Acceptance test cases (copy for QA)

Login as any demo role → dashboard renders role-appropriate items.

Employee can mark attendance and see it appear in Monthly log.

Employee can submit a leave request; Payroll/Admin can approve; status updates throughout.

Payroll Officer can create a payrun for a month; payslip is viewable and printable. Calculations should follow specified rules.

Admin can add/edit/delete employees; changes persist on reload.

Reset demo data restores seeded data.

Optional enhancements (if time)

CSV export of employee list and payslips.

Drag-and-drop avatar upload (store base64).

Tiny search autosuggest in directory.

Filterable and paginated tables.,  make sure all the features are working
